# ⚡️ Pulse Next Prototype
A fresh prototype for building out design work for our Pulse application. The goal of this project is to demonstrate all the components needed to port our app entirely to `styled-compents`. 

This prototype incorporates [Next.js](https://https://nextjs.org/) as well as [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and [Rebass](https://rebassjs.org/).

## Getting Started
After cloning this repo, install dependencies by running `npm install`.

After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development environment by running `npm run dev`.
